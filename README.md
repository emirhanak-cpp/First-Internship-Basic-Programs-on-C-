# First-Internship-Basic-Programs-on-C-
A few of the basic C# projects I've done in my first internship. Unfortunately I can't publish the complex ones because of confidentiality reasons.
The .zip pacakge includes a quadratic equation calculator, a decimal to hexadecimal calculator and a bit by bit hexadecimal converter.
As you can see they are small projects but they are only what I can show on GitHub.
